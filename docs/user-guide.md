## Adjusting note speed

As you play higher-level songs, notes becomes more dense and it becomes harder
to read the notes and time them correctly.

To make it easier to read the notes, you can increase the **note speed.** The
note speed multiplier makes note fall down faster, but it also means notes are
more spaced apart:
