    you get! The maximum score for every level is 555555.

4.  The **BPM indicator** shows how fast the song is, measured in beats per
    minutes.

5.  The **now playing** box shows the information about the current song.

## Adjusting note speed

As you play higher-level songs, notes becomes more dense and it becomes harder
to read the notes and time them correctly.

To make it easier to read the notes, you can increase the **note speed.** The
note speed multiplier makes note fall down faster, but it also means notes are
more spaced apart.

To adjust the note speed in-game:

* Press the <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> (Arrow Up) key to increase note speed by 0.5x.
* Press the <kbd>&darr;</kbd> (Arrow Down) key to decrease note speed by 0.5x.
* Press <kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>&uarr;</kbd> (Alt + Arrow Up) key to increase the
  notepeed by 0.1x.
* Press <kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>&darr;</kbd> (Alt + Arrow Down) key to decrease the
  notepeed by 0.1x.
