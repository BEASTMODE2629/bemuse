title: Getting Started (Windows)
---

This setup guide is based on Windows 10, but should also work on Windows 7 or
above. This guide assumes some command-line knowledge.

## Installing Prerequisites

### GitHub for Windows

GitHub for Windows makes it easy to get started using Git and GitHub on Windows.

Download GitHub for Windows from <https://windows.github.com/>. Install it and
sign in using your GitHub account.

### Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime outside the browser. We use it to perform build
tasks (such as compiling the source codes, running tests, static analysis, and
performing deployment tasks).

Download the Node.js installer from <https://nodejs.org>

### Git for Windows

While GitHub for Windows provides a nice GUI to work with git, since Bemuse is
developed on multiple platforms, we recommend that we work with git using the
`git` command-line, so we willl use Git for Windows.

Download the Git for Windows installer from <http://gitforwindows.org/>.

    When installing, make sure to check the "Use Git from the Windows
    Command Prompt" option, to add the <code>git</code> command to your
    PATH. This allows you to access the <code>git</code> CLI from your
    <code>cmd</code> or PowerShell.
  </p>

This should also install the "Git Bash", a `bash` environment for Windows which
we will use in this guide.

### Restart Your Computer

These tools modify your system `PATH` variable. They need to be reloaded. One of
the easiest and most reliable way to do it is to restart your computer.

## Setting Up the Project

Create an empty folder for the Bemuse project, then clone the following
repositories into that folder using GitHub for Windows:

* <a href="https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse">bemusic/bemuse</a><br> The game
  repository.

After cloning them, open the root project folder with your preferred
command-line.

For `cmd` or PowerShell, `cd` into the Bemuse repository:

```bash
cd bemuse
```

For `bash`, right click the `bemuse` project folder and select "Git Bash here."

### Install `yarn`

Note that we use `yarn` to install our Node.js dependencies, not `npm`.

Install Yarn from [Yarnâ€™s install page](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

### Install Project Dependencies

The Bemuse project depends on hundreds of other free software projects. Install
these dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
yarn
```

### Start the Development Server

To start the development server, type in:

```bash
yarn start
```

The game should be accessible at `http://localhost:8080/`.

### Run Unit Tests

To run unit tests, go to `http://localhost:8080/?mode=test`.
